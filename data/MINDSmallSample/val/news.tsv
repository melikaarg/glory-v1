They haven't quite stood the test of time. A trend that was so ubiquitous in one particular era that it instantly dates your home can be a flag to friends (or future homeowners, if you're thinking about selling) that you haven't renovated in decades. Of course, you may not care if your home is on trend. If you absolutely love a quirky feature, by all means keep it.

N60245	video	animals	Majestic & happy elephants enjoy swim in river	Elephants are majestic and beautiful creatures. They are one of the most intelligent animals we know, although we are only recently beginning to understand their intellectual and emotional capacity fully. They are a wonder to behold in a natural setting, such as this river, where they frolic and play, enjoying the bath. Elephants are capable swimmers and they can hold their breath and submerge completely. They benefit from the cool water on a hot day and they frequently bath and splash when they get the chance, grooming and cleaning themselves. Elephants have complex social structure in their herds and they form strong attachments to other elephants that last many years. Capable of long memory, complex understanding, and emotional attachment, they are far more like humans than we once realized. Yet, elephants have been kept in zoos and on farms, exploited for amusement, labor, and financial gain. Under increasing pressure from concerned groups, governments are now outlawing such practices and making it harder to take advantage of these wonderful animals. People are now understanding that elephant rides and zoos are inhumane for such large animals. Sanctuaries and rehabilitation facilities are becoming more common and tourism is favoring facilities with ample room for them and proper conditions. Seeing elephants in a setting like this will take one's breath away. Seeing them behind the bars of a cage just doesn't compare.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAJmprb.html	[]	[]

N47479	tv	tv-gallery	'Yabba Dabba Doo!' Kimye and Kids Rock Flintstone Halloween Costumes	"Fall family fun! Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and their kids went all out with elaborate Flintstone family costumes for Halloween. ""Yabba Dabba Doo!"" the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 39, captioned a series of photos of herself with her children North, 6, Saint, 4, Chicago, 21 months, and Psalm, 5 months. ""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss."""	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAJGRsP.html	"[{""Label"": ""Fred Flintstone"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q614889"", ""Confidence"": 0.999, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [1], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Yabba Dabba Doo""]}, {""Label"": ""Kim Kardashian"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q186304"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [19], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Kimye""]}, {""Label"": ""Halloween costume"", ""Type"": ""U"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q5643122"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [50], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Halloween Costumes""]}]"	"[{""Label"": ""E!

N33947	video	animals	Terrifying moment wild elephant CRUSHES passing car on mountain road in Thailand	"This is the terrifying moment a wild elephant crushed a passing car after refusing to let it drive by on a mountain road. The jumbo noticed the grey Toyota approaching on a bend in Nakhon Rathashima, northeastern Thailand, last Tuesday (October 29) afternoon. The large bull stomped over to the vehicle and kneeled on the bonnet before walking behind and laying its huge body across the rear windscreen. Shocked driver Phassakorn Niltarach was left cowering behind the steering wheel while the beast smashed the glass and dented the bodywork and damaged the mirrors. The vehicle eventually managed to move forward after the ordeal, lasting more than a minute. The woman who recorded the video is heard saying ""are you crazy?"" She then adds: ''You should have driven away earlier before the elephant had chance to do that."" Speaking after, the woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ''I was so shocked when the elephant walked to the car and I was even more surprised when the elephant tried to sit on that car. ""It's lucky that the driver managed to get away safely. I want this to be an example because people should stay well away from the elephants. They might appear friendly but they could hurt you."" Wildlife rangers in the Khao Yai National Park said that the elephant was a 35-year-old male named Deu. They warned drivers to take extra care when driving through the mountain roads, where elephants often roam. Park ranger Kanchit Sarinpawan said that elephants often venture out of the forest around October when the country's monsoon rainy season ends and the dry and cool period begins. The official reassured motorists that the elephant's behaviour was ''just his way of greeting tourists."""	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/BBWrU1N.html	"[{""Label"": ""Thailand"", ""Type"": ""G"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q869"", ""Confidence"": 0.997, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [72], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Thailand""]}]"	"[{""Label"": ""Khao Yai National Park"", ""Type"": ""L"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q386420"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [1236, 1424], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Khao Yai National Park"", ""Park""]}, {""Label"": ""Thailand"", ""Type"": ""G"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q869"", ""Confidence"": 0.997, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [213], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Thailand""]}, {""Label"": ""Toyota"", ""Type"": ""O"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q53268"", ""Confidence"": 0.986, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [149], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Toyota""]}]"
