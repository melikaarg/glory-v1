N37414	music	music-gallery	The best hair metal bands	The hair, or glam, metal bands of the 1980s remain one of the true guilty pleasures in the history of music. The hair spray, makeup and catchy pop tunes touched up with distortion were made for MTV. Though there really wasn't much substance to the music, the scene was popular to the mainstream nonetheless. So we've decided to rank our 20 hair metal bands of all time. But before we go on, bands like Def Leppard, Kiss, Scorpions, Whitesnake, Extreme and Tesla are not on this list. While, yes, some of these groups made massively successful pop-tinged metal albums during the '80s, they were either already successfully established hard-rock acts before this time and went for some easy money or were unjustly lumped into the genre thanks to MTV. With that said, here we go.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAGKFf4.html	[]	"[{""Label"": ""Tesla (band)"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q1428953"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [456], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Tesla""]}, {""Label"": ""Kiss (band)"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q124179"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [415], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Kiss""]}, {""Label"": ""Whitesnake"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q189965"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [432], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Whitesnake""]}, {""Label"": ""Scorpions (band)"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q124147"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [421], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Scorpions""]}, {""Label"": ""Def Leppard"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q182890"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [402], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Def Leppard""]}, {""Label"": ""Extreme (band)"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q682710"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [444], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Extreme""]}, {""Label"": ""MTV"", ""Type"": ""M"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q43359"", ""Confidence"": 0.999, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [194, 744], ""SurfaceForms"": [""MTV"", ""MTV""]}]"

N48124	autos	autosnews	Here's How Bad BMW's Big Grille Problem Could Get	Ladies and gentlemen, it pains us to bring you this most tragic of slideshows. Actually, it really doesn't. In fact, we're rather excited to showcase what the future might hold for BMW should this current fascination with fantastically large grilles be allowed to continue unchecked. Perhaps this in-your-face display of kidneys gone wild will at least encourage designers in Munich to think twice before traveling further down this road. Us Motor1.com scribes work very hard to keep a neutral tone, but frankly, we're a bit worried about BMW. This big-grille fad is as ridiculous as the pet rock only without the cool hipster factor. It's as off-putting as listening to glam rock on a scratched-up record. We blame Lexus for this, and while some brands have pulled off the gaping grille with admirable results   we're looking at you, Audi RS6 Avant   oversized kidneys basically turn every BMW into a beaver joke waiting to happen. That's not a good thing. Bigger Isn't Better: BMW Concept 4 Debuts With Massive Double Kidney Grille Reviled BMW Concept 4 Grille Redesigned By Another Fan We aren't alone on this. Peruse the comments of any Motor1.com articles referencing this bonkers nose and you'll find plenty of criticism. Rendering artists the world over have attempted to make the big grille look better, while others   including the anonymous designer who graciously sent us the designs featured above   are ready to show us a world where every BMW is, in a word, ugly. And yes, with BMW's deep involvement in the Toyota Supra, we couldn't resist leading with a makeover that could well come to the Supra's convertible twin, the Z4. Sure, the facelift could've been on an actual Z4, but seeing the double kidney on a Supra has a bit more shock factor. Jump into the slideshow at the top of this article to see just how deep   and how big   this kidney-shaped rabbit hole can grow.	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAJ7Jjb.html	"[{""Label"": ""BMW"", ""Type"": ""O"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q26678"", ""Confidence"": 0.999, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [15], ""SurfaceForms"": [""BMW""]}, {""Label"": ""Here's How (TV series)"", ""Type"": ""U"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q16995241"", ""Confidence"": 0.95, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [0], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Here's How""]}]"	"[{""Label"": ""Munich"", ""Type"": ""G"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q1726"", ""Confidence"": 0.997, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [376], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Munich""]}, {""Label"": ""Audi RS 6"", ""Type"": ""V"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q738104"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [835], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Audi RS6 Avant""]}, {""Label"": ""Lexus"", ""Type"": ""O"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q35919"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [716], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Lexus""]}, {""Label"": ""BMW Z"", ""Type"": ""V"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q2332702"", ""Confidence"": 0.909, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [1637, 1687], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Z4"", ""Z4""]}, {""Label"": ""Toyota Supra"", ""Type"": ""V"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q647404"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [1522, 1607, 1725], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Toyota Supra"", ""Supra"", ""Supra""]}, {""Label"": ""BMW"", ""Type"": ""O"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q26678"", ""Confidence"": 0.999, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [181, 539, 891, 1453, 1492], ""SurfaceForms"": [""BMW"", ""BMW"", ""BMW"", ""BMW"", ""BMW""]}]"

""This family pic was such a challenge because Chicago was so scared of Dino! LOL We tried to explain and show her that it was just daddy but she didn't get the concept yet! So shout out to the photographer for editing her in & making our family Flinstones dreams come true!"" While the reality star channeled Betty Rubble in a black wig and blue dress, her son looked just like Fred Flintstone. His older sister wore a red wig and all-white as Wilma Flintstone, and his younger one was all smiles as Bamm-Bamm Rubble. Kardashian held Psalm in a tiny version of the outfit. North also dressed up for Halloween with her cousin Penelope and their friend. Kourtney Kardashian's daughter, 7, rocked a long white wig and an angel-devil costume, while North was a straight devil in red fur. As for Kim, the makeup mogul debuted an extravagant Elle Woods costume, channeling Reese Witherspoon in Legally Blonde. The Selfish author even recreated the character's iconic Harvard video essay from the 2001 movie, wearing pink and green sequined bathing suits and a pink dress, all with a blonde wig. The KKW Beauty creator has passed on her love of fashion and beauty to her daughter North. The little one loves makeup, but her dad, 42, doesn't approve. ""Her dad won't let her wear it,"" Kim told E! News in September. ""I think he had it, he changed all the rules. I'd let her wear, you know, she has a little red for Christmas, I'd let her wear a red lip, or I'd let her do one pop of something. I'd let her if she's wearing a black dress, a black lip. Kylie [Jenner] would give her all of these lip kits, so I kind of got in trouble for that. So, it's now no more makeup."" The Los Angeles native opened up about their disagreement further the following month, telling the outlet: ""North is trying to get in on the makeup, but she's being blocked heavily because her dad has stopped all makeup for her until she is a teenager. It's a big discussion, a big fight in the household right now but it is what's best. I think as a parent you just learn and figure it out as you go and we realized we didn't really want her to wear makeup at a young age but she sees her mom putting on lipstick and lip gloss."""	https://assets.msn.com/labs/mind/AAJGRsP.html	"[{""Label"": ""Fred Flintstone"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q614889"", ""Confidence"": 0.999, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [1], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Yabba Dabba Doo""]}, {""Label"": ""Kim Kardashian"", ""Type"": ""P"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q186304"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [19], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Kimye""]}, {""Label"": ""Halloween costume"", ""Type"": ""U"", ""WikidataId"": ""Q5643122"", ""Confidence"": 1.0, ""OccurrenceOffsets"": [50], ""SurfaceForms"": [""Halloween Costumes""]}]"	"[{""Label"": ""E!

N43195	video	popculture	A controversial comedian and a former child star are eliminated on 'Masked Singer'	After some dumb thing called the World Series tragically preempted The Masked Singer for two friggin' weeks in a friggin' row   prompting Twitter outrage and ruining everyone's Halloween-week fun (for Masked Singer fans, apparently there is crying in baseball)   this Wednesday, Fox finally got back to focusing on America's real favorite pastime: watching C- and D-list mystery celebrities dress up in Halloween-inspo costumes and belt out Lizzo and OneRepublic hits. And it was a double-header, to use some baseball terminology, because Fox made up for lost time by airing two episodes back-to-back. Of course, double the fun meant double the eliminations, so this week we had to bid farewell to two furry friends: the Penguin, aka comedian Sherri Shepherd, and the Black Widow, aka former child star Raven-Symone. Jenny McCarthy had guessed that pretty much every female contestant since Season1 was Shepherd, so she was destined to be correct eventually. As for the Black Widow, I got that one right. I knew that eight-legged diva was so Raven from the very beginning. Anyway, while I have missed The Masked Singer like a Rottweiler misses his bone, a flower misses the sun, or a black widow misses her web, on the plus side, the past two weeks have given me some time off to reflect, furiously pore over various Google search queries and Wikipedia pages, and change my uneducated guesses since the last time many of these kooky cosplay characters rocked the mic.
